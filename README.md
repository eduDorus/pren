### PREN Image Recognition with CNN

The goal of our project module PREN is to let a robot drive through an obstacle course. There are some details that I might upload once the project is done and I get a positive response from our school to open source this. We are a team of 7 members and my part of the project is to recognise different digits on a wall while the robot is driving. To make this work I choose to stick with deep learning aka CNN. The project is built on tensorflow and tflearn. There are some performance issues running this on a raspberry pi.
